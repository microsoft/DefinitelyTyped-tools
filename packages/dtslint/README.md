`dtslint` tests a TypeScript declaration file for style and correctness.
It will install `typescript` and `tslint` for you, so this is the only tool you need to test a type definition.


# Setup

If you are working on DefinitelyTyped, read the [DefinitelyTyped README](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#readme).

If you are writing the library in TypeScript, don't use `dtslint`.
Use [`--declaration`](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) to have type definitions generated for you.

If you are a library author, read below.


## Add types for a library (not on DefinitelyTyped)

[`dts-gen`](https://github.com/Microsoft/dts-gen#readme) may help, but is not required.

Create a `types` directory. (Name is arbitrary.)
Add `"types": "types"` to your `package.json`.
Read more on bundling types [here](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/publishing.html).


#### `types/index.d.ts`

Only `index.d.ts` needs to be published to NPM. Other files are just for testing.
Write your type definitions here.
Refer to the [handbook](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) or `dts-gen`'s templates for how to do this.


#### `types/tsconfig.json`

```ts
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "lib": ["es6"],
        "noImplicitAny": true,
        "noImplicitThis": true,
        "strictNullChecks": true,

        // If the library is an external module (uses `export`), this allows your test file to import "mylib" instead of "./index".
        // If the library is global (cannot be imported via `import` or `require`), leave this out.
        "baseUrl": ".",
        "paths": { "mylib": ["."] }
    }
}
```

You may extend `"lib"` to, for example, `["es6", "dom"]` if you need those typings.
You may also have add `"target": "es6"` if using certain language features.


#### `types/tslint.json`

If you are using the default rules, this is optional.

If present, this will override `dtslint`'s [default](https://github.com/Microsoft/dtslint/blob/master/dtslint.json) settings.
You can specify new lint [rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/), or disable some. An example:

```json
{
    "extends": "dtslint/dtslint.json",
    "rules": {
        "semicolon": false,
        "indent": [true, "tabs"]
    }
}
```


#### `types/test.ts`

You can have any number of test files you want, with any names. See below on what to put in them.



## Write tests

A test file should be a piece of sample code that tests using the library. Tests are type-checked, but not run.
To assert that an expression is of a given type, use `$ExpectType`.
To assert that an expression causes a compile error, use `$ExpectError`.
(Assertions will be checked by the `expect` lint rule.)

```ts
import { f } from "my-lib"; // f is(n: number) => void

// $ExpectType void
f(1);

// Can also write the assertion on the same line.
f(2); // $ExpectType void

// $ExpectError
f("one");
```


## Specify a TypeScript version

Normally packages will be tested using TypeScript 2.0.
To use a newer version, specify it by including a comment like so:

```ts
// TypeScript Version: 2.1
```

For DefinitelyTyped packages, this should go just under the header (on line 5).
For bundled typings, this can go on any line (but should be near the top).


## Run tests

- `npm install --save-dev dtslint`
- Add to your `package.json` `scripts`: `"dtslint": "dtslint types"`
- `npm run dtslint`


# Contributing

## Build

```sh
npm link . # Global 'dts-lint' should now refer to this.
npm run watch
```

Note: If changing a lint rule, you will have to `dtslint --clean` because rules are copied into install directories.

## Test

Use `npm run test` to run all tests.
To run a single test: `node node_modules/tslint/bin/tslint --rulesDirectory bin/rules --test test/expect`.


## Publish

#### `production` branch

```sh
git checkout production
git merge master
npm run build
git add --all
git commit -m "Update bin/"
git push
```

The `production` branch is a dependency of [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) and [types-publisher](https://github.com/Microsoft/types-publisher).
