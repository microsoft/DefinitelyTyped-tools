These accounts get automatically pinged for reviews on future PRs (like you were pinged here), and when they approve, the PRs get fast-tracked to merge. The reason we have to delete inactive ones is that GitHub releases the usernames of deleted accounts after a while, so new users could be signing up and be getting pinged for reviews of something they‚Äôve never heard of. I‚Äôm sympathetic to the unintended consequence of erasing something that someone wanted attribution for, but the reality is that people intentionally remove themselves from these headers all the time when they want to stop getting pinged for reviews, and we have no way of continuing to list them as contributors either, other than in the historical record (both in the git history and in the published package.jsons)‚Äîthat‚Äôs just not what the header was made for.",
