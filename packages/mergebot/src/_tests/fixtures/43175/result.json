Please consider [adding tests](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#user-content-test-editing-an-existing-package) to cover the change you're making. Including tests allows this PR to be merged by yourself and the owners of this module.\n\n***This can potentially save days of time for you!***"
