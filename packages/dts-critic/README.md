# dts-critic
Checks a new dts against the Javascript sources and tells you what problems it has

There's nothing here yet!
Planned work: 

1. Make sure your module structure fits the source.
2. Make sure your exported symbols match the source.
3. Make sure your types match the source types???
4. Have a command line interface to point at d.ts and source folder. 
5. Have a command line interface to point to DT folder.
6. Understand DT headers + download associated source.

Note that for real use on Definitely Typed, a lot of these checks need to be pretty loose.
