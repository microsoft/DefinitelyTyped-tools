# DefinitelyTyped-tools

A monorepo for formerly disparate DefinitelyTyped-related tools:

- [definitions-parser](packages/definitions-parser): the part of [microsoft/types-publisher](https://github.com/microsoft/types-publisher) that reads DefinitelyTyped repository data
- [dtslint](packages/dtslint): [microsoft/dtslint](https://github.com/microsoft/dtslint)
- [dtslint-runner](packages/dtslint-runner): [DefinitelyTyped/dtslint-runner](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/dtslint-runner)
- [dts-critic](packages/dts-critic): [DefinitelyTyped/dts-critic](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/dts-critic)
- [header-parser](packages/header-parser): [microsoft/definitelytyped-header-parser](https://github.com/microsoft/definitelytyped-header-parser)
- [perf](packages/perf): [andrewbranch/definitely-not-slow](https://github.com/andrewbranch/definitely-not-slow)
- [publisher](packages/publisher): the rest of [microsoft/types-publisher](https://github.com/microsoft/types-publisher)
- [retag](packages/retag): [DefinitelyTyped/dt-retag](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/dt-retag)
- [typescript-versions](packages/typescript-versions): the part of [definitelytyped-header-parser](https://github.com/microsoft/definitelytyped-header-parser) that tracked which TypeScript versions are published to npm and supported on DefinitelyTyped
- [utils](packages/utils): shared utilities, mostly extracted from [microsoft/types-publisher](https://github.com/microsoft/types-publisher)

## Disclaimer

These tools are not intended for public consumption, so we may break the API whenever convenient for us.

## Development

This is a monorepo managed with [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) and [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). After cloning, run `yarn` to install dependencies for each package and link them to each other.

### Testing

All packages use [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), with a single configuration set up to be run from the monorepo root. `yarn test` is an alias for `jest`, so you can run tests with any of [jestâ€™s CLI options](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli). For example, to run tests for a single package:

```sh
yarn test packages/utils
```
